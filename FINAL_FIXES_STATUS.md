# Comprehensive Fixes - Final Status

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. **Frontend API Configuration** âœ…
- Created centralized `apiConfig.ts` that uses relative paths in production
- Updated **14 files** to use `getApiPath()` function:
  - Core API files (adminAuthApi, authApi, adminApi, buyerApi, api.ts)
  - Page components (SellerLanding)
  - All CRM pages (Dashboard, TableView, KanbanView, LeadDetail, Reports, Tasks, EmployeeList)
  - CRM components (DocumentUpload)
- Frontend rebuilt successfully on VM
- Build completed with no errors

### 2. **Backend Health Endpoint** âœ…
- Added `/api/health` route to `server.js` for Nginx proxy access
- Route responds with: `{"status":"ok","message":"Suvarna Capital API is running"}`

### 3. **Test Account Creation Script** âœ…
- Fixed syntax error (`prisma.\$disconnect()` â†’ `prisma.$disconnect()`)
- Script creates accounts for:
  - Buyer: `buyer@testcompany.com` / `BuyerTest2025!`
  - Employee (Agent): `employee@crm.com` / `EmployeeTest2025!`
  - Employee (Manager): `manager@crm.com` / `ManagerTest2025!`
  - Employee (Super Admin): `superadmin@crm.com` / `SuperAdminTest2025!`

## ðŸ”„ Remaining Issues

### Issue 1: Nginx Proxy Routing
**Problem:** `/api/health` returns `Cannot GET /api/health` instead of JSON response

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Backend is running on port 8000 âœ…
- Backend has `/health` endpoint âœ…
- Backend has `/api/health` endpoint (local file updated, need to sync to VM)
- Nginx config: `proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;` (without trailing slash = keeps `/api/` prefix)
- When request comes for `/api/health`, Nginx forwards to `http://localhost:8000/api/health`
- Backend needs to handle `/api/health` route âœ…

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `/api/health` route to backend `server.js`
- Created fix script to update VM's server.js
- Need to verify the route was added and backend restarted

### Issue 2: Frontend Still Shows "Failed to Fetch"
**Possible Causes:**
1. Frontend not rebuilt with latest changes (resolved - rebuilt)
2. Browser cache showing old frontend build
3. Nginx proxy not routing correctly
4. Backend `/api/health` route not active on VM

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify backend `/api/health` route is active
2. Test API endpoint via curl
3. Clear browser cache and retest login
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

## ðŸ“‹ Fix Scripts Created

1. **`fix-backend-health.sh`** - Script to add `/api/health` route to backend server.js on VM
2. **`create-test-accounts.js`** - Script to create test accounts for all user types

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### API Path Resolution
- **Production:** Uses relative paths (empty base URL)
  - Request: `/api/admin/login`
  - Browser resolves: `http://35.225.94.127/api/admin/login`
  - Nginx proxies to: `http://localhost:8000/api/admin/login`

- **Development:** Uses full URL
  - Request: `http://localhost:8000/api/admin/login`
  - Direct connection to backend

### Nginx Proxy Configuration
```nginx
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
    # Without trailing slash = keeps /api/ prefix
    # /api/health â†’ http://localhost:8000/api/health
}
```

### Backend Routes
- All routes are prefixed with `/api/`:
  - `/api/auth/*`
  - `/api/admin/*`
  - `/api/buyer/*`
  - `/api/employees/*`
  - `/api/crm/*`
  - `/api/health` âœ… (added)

## âœ… Verification Checklist

- [x] Frontend API configuration centralized
- [x] All API files updated to use `getApiPath()`
- [x] Frontend rebuilt successfully
- [x] Backend `/api/health` route added (local)
- [ ] Backend `/api/health` route verified on VM
- [ ] Test accounts created successfully
- [ ] Admin login working in browser
- [ ] Buyer login working in browser
- [ ] Employee login working in browser

---

**Status:** Core fixes complete. Need to verify backend route is active on VM and test browser logins.
