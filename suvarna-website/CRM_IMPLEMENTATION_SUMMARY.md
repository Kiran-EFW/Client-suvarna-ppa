## Role-Based Access Control

### Super Admin
- Full access to all features
- Employee management (create, edit, deactivate)
- View all leads across all teams
- Manage all tasks
- System configuration

### Manager
- View leads assigned to their team
- Assign leads to agents in their team
- Create and manage tasks for team members
- View team performance statistics
- Cannot access employee management

### Agent
- View only their assigned leads
- Update status of assigned leads
- Add activities and tasks to assigned leads
- Complete their own tasks
- Cannot reassign leads
- Cannot access team statistics

## Authentication Flow

1. Employees login at `/employee/login` with email and password
2. JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookie
3. `EmployeeProtectedRoute` checks localStorage for employee data
4. All API calls include credentials
5. Backend validates token and attaches employee to request
6. Role-based middleware enforces permissions

## Default Credentials

**Super Admin:**
- Email: `admin@suvarnacapital.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

Created via seed script: `backend/scripts/seedEmployee.js`

## Routes Summary

### Employee Routes

## Outstanding Items

### Low Priority

2. **Document Upload** - File upload functionality (backend ready, needs UI)
3. **Email Notifications** - Activity and task notifications
4. **PPA Marketplace Integration** - Convert PPA buyers to leads
